<banner>Deploying a web application: an example</banner>

Suppose you have a web application in <b>/somewhere</b>. Add a virtual host to your
Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to <b>/somewhere/public</b>:
<b>
   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.yourhost.com
      # !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    
      <Directory /somewhere/public>
         # This relaxes Apache security settings.
         AllowOverride all
         # MultiViews must be turned off.
         Options -MultiViews
         # Uncomment this if you're on Apache >= 2.4:
         #Require all granted
      </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
</b>
