<banner>Installation through RPMs recommended</banner>

It looks like you are on a Red Hat or CentOS operating system, with <b>SELinux</b>
enabled. SELinux is a security mechanism for which special <%= SHORT_PROGRAM_NAME %>-specific
configuration is required. We supply this configuration as part of
our <%= SHORT_PROGRAM_NAME %> <b>RPMs</b>.

However, <%= SHORT_PROGRAM_NAME %> is currently installed through <%= PhusionPassenger.packaging_method_description %> and does not
include any SELinux configuration. Therefore, we recommend that you:

 1. Uninstall your current <%= SHORT_PROGRAM_NAME %> install.
 2. Reinstall <%= SHORT_PROGRAM_NAME %> through the RPMs that we provide:
    <yellow><%= APACHE2_DOC_URL %>#installing_or_upgrading_on_red_hat</yellow>

<b>Press Ctrl-C to exit this installer so that you can install RPMs (recommended)</b>
  -OR-
<b>Press Enter to continue using this installer anyway</b>
